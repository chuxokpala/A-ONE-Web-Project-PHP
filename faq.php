            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>4. What is the average lifespan of a solar system?</h3>
                <p>While most solar panels have a lifespan of 20–25 years, system performance depends on quality, usage, environmental conditions, and regular maintenance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>5. Do you assist with financing or flexible payment options?</h3>
                <p>We collaborate with financing partners and provide guidance on available energy financing schemes. Specific terms and availability may vary depending on project location and size.</p>
